## Introduction
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that aims to help you to create and manage your notes using the [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method.

You can configure your own workflow using a canvas, where each node its a file and each edge is a link between them. The files will contain the frontmatter and the template content that you define, also you can define custom configurations related to the plugin for each file. ([check our configuration examples here](https://github.com/RafaelGB/Obsidian-ZettlelFlow/tree/main/WorkFlow%20Test))
