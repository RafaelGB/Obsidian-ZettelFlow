## Introduction to Community Resources
ZettelFlow allows the community to share templates, flows, and actions to help users enhance their note-taking experience. The Community section provides pre-built resources that you can easily import and use in your own Obsidian vault.

## Types of Community Resources
ZettelFlow offers four main types of community resources:

### 1. Flows
Flows are complete workflows designed to guide you through specific note-taking processes. These are particularly valuable because:

- Ready to use: No technical knowledge required
- Time-saving: No need to build workflows from scratch
- Best practice: Created by experienced users
- Versatile: Available for many different note-taking scenarios

### 2. Steps
Steps are individual components that can be added to your existing workflows. They represent a single action or decision point in a note creation process.

### 3. Actions
Actions are specific functions that can be performed within a step, such as adding a date, selecting options, or running scripts.

### 4. Markdown
Markdown templates provide reusable text content that can be incorporated into your notes.
